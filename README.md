### Project 1: MyReads
A simple library web app to search for books and manage your collections of titles across "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read" categories.

#### Usage
* Open the directory in terminal
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
* Open a browser window to address `localhost:3000`

#### Details
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.


#### Dependencies + References
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
